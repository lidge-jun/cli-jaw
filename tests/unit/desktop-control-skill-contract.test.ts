// These read the skills_ref submodule, so a skills change requires the gitlink
// to be bumped before root tests pass — which is the point: the shipped skill
// and the shipped prompt cannot drift apart silently.

// DCS-003 and DCS-004 used to require the literal tool names `list_windows()`,
// `get_window_state`, `get_app_state(app)`, `select_text` and `node_repl`.
//
// Those names came from an older Codex build. On a current host the
// `computer-use@openai-bundled` plugin can be enabled, its `.mcp.json` can
// still declare the server, and NO `mcp__computer_use__*` tool is exposed to
// the session — the host provides a CUA JavaScript session instead. So the
// assertions were pinning an inventory that no longer resolves, and passing
// them meant the reference had to keep instructing calls that do not exist.
//
// What survives a host change is the platform SHAPE, which is what these check
// now: app-scoped on macOS, window-scoped on Windows, no host on Linux. The
// tests must not name tools for the same reason the reference stopped naming
// them.
