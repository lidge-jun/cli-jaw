// The call site in spawn.ts is inside a 3000-line function with no injection
// point, so this covers the judgment rather than the wiring; the wiring is
// checked on a live host (see the plan's verification section).

// A stream-json line is longer than ten characters, so `observe()` already

// absoluteMs. Marking it structured does not buy TIME — it buys a stall report
// that distinguishes "the runtime was still working" from "bytes were
// appearing", which is the difference the 933s incident turned on.
