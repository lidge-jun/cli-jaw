// #308 originally pinned the RIGHT Computer Use API per platform, because
// telling a Windows agent to call a macOS-only tool produced an opaque runtime
// error rather than a clean precondition failure.
//
// That intent still matters, but the tool names it asserted are gone. A current
// Codex build exposes no `mcp__computer_use__*` tool at all - even with the
// computer-use plugin enabled and declaring its MCP server - and provides a CUA
// JavaScript session instead. Pinning names made the templates fail closed
// against a surface that no longer exists.
//
// So these tests now assert what survives a host change: the prompts must tell
// the agent to establish the surface rather than assume it, must keep the
// platform SHAPE distinction (macOS app-scoped, Windows window-scoped), must
// preserve the two Windows results that look like success, and must keep the
// sandbox flag honest.
