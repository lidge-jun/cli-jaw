/**
 * The one place that says why a test file can skip, and whether CI is allowed
 * to accept that skip (#689).
 *
 * Skips were not the problem on their own. The problem was that nobody could
 * tell an intentional local affordance from a test that had quietly stopped
 * running: tests/run.mts counts failures and never skips, so a file that opts
 * out is indistinguishable from one that passed. Writing the reason down is
 * half of it; the other half is tests/integration/skip-policy.test.ts, which
 * fails when a file skips without appearing here and when an entry here no
 * longer matches a real skip.
 *
 * Policies:
 *   ci-required        the dependency EXISTS on the CI lane that runs this
 *                      file, so a skip there is a bug. The skip is a local
 *                      affordance and the file must fail closed under CI.
 *   local-skip-allowed the dependency is genuinely optional; skipping is fine
 *                      anywhere, including CI.
 *   opt-in-isolated    needs a flag, a credential or a host CI does not have.
 *                      Intentionally quarantined; see the note for what would
 *                      have to change to make it required.
 *   platform           the skip is an OS or architecture gate. It runs on the
 *                      lane that has that platform and skips on the others,
 *                      which is correct rather than a gap.
