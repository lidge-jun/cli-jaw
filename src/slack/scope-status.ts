// ─── Slack OAuth scope drift ────────────────────────
// A Slack app created from an older cli-jaw manifest keeps its original grant
// forever. Adding a scope to `manifest.ts` changes what NEW apps get; it does
// nothing for an app already installed. The transport then connects, health
// reports ok, messages are answered — and every users.info/conversations.info
// call fails with missing_scope, so senders degrade to raw ids.
//
// The gap is knowable for free: Slack returns the token's whole granted set in
// the `x-oauth-scopes` header of every Web API response, and the transport
// already calls auth.test on every start. This module owns the resulting state
// so doctor, /api/health and the identity warning all read one answer instead
// of computing three.
//
// Reported as #340.
