// ─── Mention watch ────────────────────────────────
// Finds messages where a WATCHED person was mentioned, so a heartbeat job can
// answer in those threads. This is not the inbound path: `mentionOnly` there
// asks whether the BOT was mentioned, and Slack's `app_mention` event only
// fires for the app itself. Nobody sends us an event when a third party is
// tagged, so the only way to see it is to read history.
//
// WHY POLLING AND NOT SEARCH
//
// `search.messages` would answer this in one call, and it is not available: it
// is a user-token method, and the bot token this app installs with carries
// `channels:history`/`groups:history` but no `search:read` (a bot token cannot
// hold it). So the scan walks the channels the bot is actually in. That bounds
// what this can see, and the bound is honest: a channel the bot never joined
// is invisible here no matter what we do.
