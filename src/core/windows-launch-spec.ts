/**
 * Resolve a Windows launch target without a command interpreter (#367).
 *
 * The problem: Node enables `shell: true` for any non-.exe command on Windows, and
 * several runtimes place the prompt directly in argv. That routes untrusted text
 * through cmd.exe parsing, where `& | < > ^ ( ) % !` stop being literal data.
 *
 * Quoting is the wrong fix. cmd.exe quoting is not CommandLineToArgvW quoting, `%VAR%`
 * expands even with delayed expansion disabled, and the ~8191-character ceiling means
 * no encoder can carry a long prompt. So we remove the shell instead: resolve the npm
 * .cmd shim to the script it runs and the interpreter that runs it, then spawn that
 * interpreter directly with shell: false.
