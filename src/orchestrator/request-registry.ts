/**
 * Request settlement registry (#276).
 *
 * `POST /api/message` always returns a requestId, but until now that id was not
 * a promise of anything. Whether a completion event ever carried it back
 * depended on which path the server happened to take:
 *
 *   - idle -> normal run: `orchestrate_done` carried the requestId. Fine.
 *   - busy + in-band steer: `steerAgent` injects the prompt into the RUNNING turn and
 *     returns. No new turn exists, so no new completion event is ever emitted.
 *   - busy + fresh orchestration: the requestId was not
 *     passed through to it or to its error broadcast.
 *   - collect queue: N requests merge into one run and only the first id
 *     survives, so N-1 callers wait forever.
 *   - queue delete / stop / shutdown / skipOrchestrate: nothing at all.
 *
 * A CLI client that submits and then waits (`jaw ask`) hangs on every one of
 * those paths. Scattering another broadcast across each completion site cannot
 * fix it: there is no way to prove the set is complete, and nothing prevents a
 * double emit.
 *
 * So settlement is a registry instead. A request is ADMITTED where its id is
 * minted, and settled through one idempotent function. That makes the
 * invariant checkable rather than asserted: after any scenario,
 * `pendingRequestIds()` must be empty. A missed call site shows up as a leak in
 * that assertion; a duplicated one is a no-op by construction.
