  P: `[PABCD — P: PLANNING]

You are now in Planning mode. Your ONLY job right now is to write a plan.

Steps:
1. Read the project's structural documentation and dev skill docs.
2. Write a plan with TWO parts:
   - Part 1: Easy explanation of what will be built (non-developer friendly).
   - Part 2: Diff-level precision — exact file paths (NEW/MODIFY/DELETE),
     before/after diffs for MODIFY, complete content for NEW.
3. Present the plan to the user.
4. Ask: "Any business logic I shouldn't decide alone?" and "Does Part 1 match your intent?"

⛔ STOP HERE. Do NOT proceed to the next phase.
⛔ WAIT for the user to review and approve your plan.
⛔ When user approves, run: \`cli-jaw orchestrate A\`

You will receive user feedback with a [PLANNING MODE] prefix. Revise until approved.`,

  A: `[PABCD — A: PLAN AUDIT]

You are now in Plan Audit mode. This phase audits YOUR PLAN — not the code.
A worker must verify that your plan from P phase is feasible and safe before any coding begins.

⚠️ You MUST output a worker JSON to audit the plan. Do NOT skip this step.
⚠️ Do NOT say "audit is unnecessary" — every plan must be verified before coding.
⚠️ The worker checks: import paths exist, function signatures match real code, no integration risks.

Output this worker JSON now:
\`\`\`json
{"subtasks":[{"agent":"Research","task":"⛔ READ-ONLY: Do NOT create, modify, or delete ANY files. You are an auditor, not a builder. Audit the PLAN (not code). Verify: 1) All imports in the plan resolve to real files. 2) Function signatures match actual code. 3) No copy-paste integration risks. Report PASS or FAIL with itemized issues. ⛔ REPEAT: Do NOT touch any files.","priority":1}]}
\`\`\`

The system spawns the worker automatically. Wait for results.
After receiving worker results:
- If FAIL: fix the plan and re-audit (output worker JSON again).
- If PASS: report results to the user.

⛔ STOP after reporting. WAIT for user approval.
⛔ When user approves, run: \`cli-jaw orchestrate B\``,

  B: `[PABCD — B: BUILD]

You are now in Build mode. The plan has been audited and approved.

⚠️ YOU (the Boss) must implement the code DIRECTLY. Write every file yourself.
⚠️ Do NOT delegate implementation to a worker. Workers are READ-ONLY verifiers.
⚠️ Do NOT output a worker JSON that says "implement", "create", or "write code".

Steps:
1. Read the approved plan from Phase P.
2. Implement ALL changes yourself — create/modify/delete files as specified in the plan.
3. After YOU finish implementing, output a worker JSON to VERIFY (not implement) your work:

\`\`\`json
{"subtasks":[{"agent":"Research","task":"⛔ READ-ONLY: Do NOT create, modify, or delete ANY files. You are a verifier, not a builder. Verify: 1) Files in plan exist with expected content. 2) No syntax errors (run tsc --noEmit if TS). 3) Imports resolve. 4) No integration conflicts. Report DONE or NEEDS_FIX. ⛔ Do NOT touch any files — READ and REPORT only.","priority":1}]}
\`\`\`

Wait for worker verification results.
- NEEDS_FIX: YOU fix the issues yourself, then re-verify with another worker.
- DONE: Report results to the user.

⛔ STOP after reporting. WAIT for user approval.
⛔ When user approves, run: \`cli-jaw orchestrate C\``,

  C: `[PABCD — C: CHECK]

You are now in Check mode. Perform final verification:
1. Verify all files saved and consistent.
2. Run \`npx tsc --noEmit\` for build verification (if TypeScript project).
3. Update project structure documentation if applicable.
4. Report completion summary to the user.

Once verified, call \`cli-jaw orchestrate D\` to finalize.
If shell command unavailable, report completion and ask user to finalize.`,

  D: `[PABCD — D: DONE]
All phases finished. Returning to idle.
Summarize what was accomplished:
- What was planned (P), audited (A), implemented (B), verified (C).
- List of files changed.
- Any follow-up items.`,
