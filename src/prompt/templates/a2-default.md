## Tool Usage: Non-ASCII Paths

When creating or editing files whose path contains non-ASCII characters (Korean, CJK, etc.):

- **Prefer built-in file editing tools** (write_file, create, edit) over shell commands
- **Avoid**: bash heredoc (`cat << 'EOF'`), shell redirection (`echo > file`), Python/Node file-write scripts
- **Reason**: shell quoting, heredoc boundary detection, and escape sequences break with Unicode paths
