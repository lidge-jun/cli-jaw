// ─── Heartbeat mention watch ─────────────────────────
// One tick of "find messages that tagged this person, answer each in its
// thread". The scan itself lives in src/slack/mention-watch.ts; this module owns
// the parts that must be durable: which messages are already answered, how far
// each channel has been read, and the rule that the SERVER posts the answer.
//
// WHY THE SERVER SENDS
//
// Letting the agent post directly makes a tick's success meaningless as evidence
// of delivery: it can answer three threads, fail on two sends, and still exit
// with a clean transcript. Here each item is a separate round trip — ask, send,
// record — so a receipt exists per message and a partial tick leaves the rest
// unrecorded for the next one to pick up.
//
// The guarantee is AT-LEAST-ONCE. If the process dies between a successful post
// and its 'seen' write, the next tick answers that message again. Exactly-once
// needs a durable reservation taken before the send plus an ambiguous state to
// resolve afterwards, which is more machinery than this is worth today. The limit
// is written down rather than papered over.
