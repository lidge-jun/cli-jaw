// ─── Heartbeat destination binding ───────────────────
// A scheduled report is written for one conversation. An operator picked it;
// nothing about the job says "wherever someone last spoke". Yet a job with no
// stored destination used to fall through to the active-channel path, and a job
// that stored only a channel was delivered to that channel's root with no way to
// tell an intentional root post from a half-filled form (#437, #745).
//
// So a destination is either complete or it is held. Complete means a thread —
// the conversation the operator pointed at — or an explicit `channel_root`
// saying the channel itself is the intended audience. A job that says neither
// has not been configured yet, and the honest response to that is silence with
// a reason in the log, not a guess that lands in someone else's thread.
